          <p class="paragraph">
            My name is Rock Kang and I am a student in NYU Abu Dhabi. I was born in Colombia,
            but my family is Korean. However, I grew up in Mexico City and therefore I am more
            familiar with the Mexican culture. This website is part of my final project for my
            Communication Lab class. All the graphics were created by me and the inspiration came
            from an artist known as Mr. Doodle. I think this theme accurately represents me given
            my diverse background and the variety of things I like and enjoy.
